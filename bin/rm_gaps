=head1 NAME

rm_gaps - remove gappy columns from multiple alignment

=head1 SYNOPSIS

rm_gaps [--cutoff <float> --min_len <int>] < aligned.fasta > out.fasta

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reads a multiple alignment in FASTA format from STDIN, removes gap columns
according to several criteria and prints to STDOUT the modified multiple
alignment as FASTA.

=head1 PREREQUISITES

Requires the following non-core Perl libraries:

=over 1

=item * BioX::Seq

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--cutoff> I<float>

Minimum fraction of sequences containing a gap at a position for that column
to be considered "gappy" and removed (default: 0.1)

=item B<--min_len> I<int>

Minimum length of a sequence "island" (that is, the region between "gappy"
columns) to be output. Islands shorter than this will be discarded. This
option can be used to filter out short aligned positions (e.g. 1 or several
nucleotides long) within otherwise poorly aligned regions. (default: 1)
