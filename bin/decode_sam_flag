=head1 NAME

decode_sam_flag - print human-readable summary of bit-encoded SAM flag

=head1 SYNOPSIS

decode_sam_flag I<decimal_SAM_flag>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility takes a single decimal integer as an argument (likely taken from
a SAM alignment file FLAG field), decodes the bitmasks based on the SAM
specification, and prints a summary of the read properties to the screen. It
can be useful during manual examination of a SAM alignment (e.g. for
troubleshooting purposes).
