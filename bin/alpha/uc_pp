=head1 NAME

uc_pp - the (sort of) universal UnCompressor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

uc_pp --in I<infile> > I<outfile>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<uc_pp> is a semi-universal front-end to various decompression programs. It
determines the type of the input file given, tries to find an appropriate
decompression program in the current PATH, and, if possible, decompresses the
file to STDOUT. The purpose is to facilitate use of heterogeneous inputs to
data analysis pipelines by providing for "universal" decompression of
compressed input data without knowing the format in advance.

=head1 SUPPORTED FORMATS

Currently, the following formats are supported. One or more of the binaries
listed below need to be present in the current PATH in order to support that
file type. If multiple options are available, one will be chosen
preferentially in the order listed.

=head2 GZIP

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 2

=item B<--in>

Path to the input file. Reading from STDIN is not supported.

=item B<--threads>

The number of threads to use for decompression. Support varies by
decompression tool. If not specified, the default for each program is
used.

=item B<--help>

Show documentation and exit

=item B<--version>

Print version string and exit

=head1 CAVEATS AND BUGS

This software has been tested on Linux only. While it should also work on
Windows, Mac OSX, BSD, and other systems with the appropriate modules
and compression tools installed, it has not been tested on these systems. 

Please report all bugs or suggestions on the software repository issues page.
