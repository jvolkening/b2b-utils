=head1 NAME

seq_diff - list differences between two sequences by position

=head1 SYNOPSIS

seq_diff < aln_file > aln_diff

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a "diff-like" program which takes an alignment of two sequences in
FASTA format on STDIN and reports the differences by base position. It is
intended to be used on similar sequences with only a few expected changes -
otherwise the list of differences might get rather long. 

=head1 PREREQUISITES

Requires the following non-core Perl libraries:
